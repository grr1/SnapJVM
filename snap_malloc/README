In test_out_of_ram, there is a call to the original malloc() after setting some values of rlimit (resource limits for the test case). This code originally was not object-oriented, and likely is being thrown off by having to initialize the MallocHeap object via `new` in initialize_test(). In GDB, the sizeof(mHeap) is 10,152, whereas the nearest multiple of 1024 is 10,240. Changing malloc(8) in ./tests/testsrc/test_out_of_ram.c to be higher does not seem to cause sbrk() to fail, however.
